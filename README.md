This is a rewrite of some [ancient spotify presence thing](https://github.com/dev-sda1/spotify-web-presence) I did a while ago,
rewritten in Rust since I'm trying to get the hang of it, and learn it.

I don't expect anyone to use this (why would you lmao) but, it was a pretty decent experience I'd say, and i'll probably
rewrite some other stuff in it too.

Sample config.json (it'll make one for you if it's missing):
```json
{
  "client_token":"",
  "client_secret":"",
  "refresh_token":""
}
```
